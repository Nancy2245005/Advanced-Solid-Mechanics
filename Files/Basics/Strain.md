### Strain

Strain is defined as the ratio of the change
in length of the material to the original
length of the material.  It is expressed as
a percentage or a decimal value, and is
denoted using the symbol "ε".  Strain is a
dimensionless quantity, meaning that it has
no units.
Strain is neither scaler nor vector . It is a tensor 
quantity.
There are several types of strain, including
axial strain, shear strain, and volumetric
strain. 
 Axial strain: It refers to the change
in length of an object that is subjected to
an applied force or load. The strain can tensile
orcompressive in nature. If the value of 
Strain comes out to be positive then it is tensile , 
if value is negative then it is compressive.
Shear strain: It refers to the change in shape of an object
due to twisting or shearing forces. 
Volumetric strain, on the other hand, refers
to the change in volume of an object in
response to a load or force.

When the pulling or pushing is applied in one
direction, causes the deformation in all the 
Orthogonal directions. For example when a force 
is applied on a rod along X-direction then the 
rod will gets compresses laterally( i.e in Y and Z 
direction).This property of material is known as 
Possion's ratio , denoted by(nu)
 Poission's ratio(ν)= -(lateral strain/longitudinal strain)
Here negative sign means decrease in dimension)
Units of poission's ratio: Unitless quantity. Because
it is a ratio of two unitless quantity.
Range of poission's ratio: From -1 to 0.5
 
Importance of strain:
Strain is an important parameter in the
study of material behaviour, and is used to
describe the elastic and plastic deformation
of materials. Strain is used to study the durability 
of a matrials.
